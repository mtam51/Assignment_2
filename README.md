<b>Introduction</b>

This assignment is to demonstrate my ability to organize issues and bugs related to quality assurance. I am using Github for this assignment and this is due for November 17th, 2020. 

<b>Branches</b> 

There is the development branch and a main (master) branch. I will always work on the development branch, never the master and create pull requests; once changes are confirmed to have no conflicts with the main, it will be allowed to be merged.
